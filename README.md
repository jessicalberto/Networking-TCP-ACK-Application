# Networking-TCP-ACK-Application
Final Project for EC441 - Computer Networking

This animation illustrates interaction between a TCP sender and receiver. We thought it would be helpful to have a visual, interactive animation based off of  diagrams and demonstrations we've gone over in class.

Our animation can demonstrate the following:

1. Packet Loss
2. ACK Loss
3. Congestion Control
4. 3-Way Handshake
